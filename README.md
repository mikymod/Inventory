# UE5 Inventory Project

This project is an inventory system developed using Unreal Engine 5 (UE5). The inventory system provides a framework for managing and organizing in-game items, allowing players to collect, store, and use various objects within the game world.

# Features

- Item Management: The inventory system provides a robust framework for managing various items within the game. Items can be added and removed based on the game's requirements.
- Item Interactions: Players can perform various actions with items in their inventory, such as using, equipping, or dropping them. The inventory system provides an interface for handling these interactions and allows for seamless integration with the game mechanics.
- Inventory UI: The project includes a pre-built user interface (UI) for displaying the player's inventory. The UI provides visual representations of the items, allowing players to interact with their inventory easily.

# Nice to have

- Item Types: Different types of items can be defined within the inventory system. Each item type can have its own unique properties, such as name, description, icon, and any other attributes specific to that item type.
- Inventory Management: The inventory system allows players to sort, filter, and search for specific items in their inventory. This makes it easier for players to find and organize their belongings based on their preferences.
- Item Stacking: The inventory system supports stacking items of the same type. This allows players to efficiently manage and organize their inventory by reducing clutter and optimizing storage space.
